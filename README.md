# Creating-a-DeFi-Kingdom-Clone-on-Avalanche

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone setup guide. This README will walk you through the process of setting up your own custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network, defining your native currency, connecting to Metamask, and deploying the basic building blocks of your game.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm
- Metamask extension for your browser
- Solidity and Remix for smart contract development

## Step 1: Set Up Your EVM Subnet

To create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network, follow the steps in our detailed [guide](#) and refer to the [Avalanche documentation](https://docs.avax.network/). This will guide you through configuring your subnet and deploying it on the Avalanche network.

## Step 2: Define Your Native Currency

Define your own native currency to be used as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone. This involves creating a smart contract that specifies the token's name, symbol, and supply. You can use the ERC-20 token standard for this purpose.

Example contract snippet:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract GameToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("GameToken", "GT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

Deploy this contract using Remix or your preferred development environment.

## Step 3: Connect to Metamask

To connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask, follow these steps:

1. Open Metamask and click on the network dropdown.
2. Select "Custom RPC".
3. Enter your subnet details:
   - Network Name: Your Subnet Name
   - New RPC URL: http://<Your_Subnet_RPC_URL>
   - Chain ID: <Your_Subnet_Chain_ID>
   - Currency Symbol: Your Native Currency Symbol (e.g., GT)
4. Save the network and switch to it.

For detailed instructions, refer to our [guide](#).

## Step 4: Deploy Basic Building Blocks

Use Solidity and Remix to deploy the basic building blocks of your game. These smart contracts will define the game rules, such as liquidity pools, tokens, battling, exploring, and trading.

Example contract for battling:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Battle {
    struct Player {
        uint256 health;
        uint256 attack;
    }

    mapping(address => Player) public players;

    function createPlayer(uint256 health, uint256 attack) public {
        players[msg.sender] = Player(health, attack);
    }

    function battle(address opponent) public view returns (string memory) {
        Player memory player1 = players[msg.sender];
        Player memory player2 = players[opponent];

        if (player1.attack > player2.health) {
            return "You win!";
        } else {
            return "You lose!";
        }
    }
}
```

Deploy these contracts using Remix and ensure they interact as expected.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have a basic setup for your DeFi Kingdom clone on a custom EVM subnet within the Avalanche network. For more advanced features and customizations, refer to the Avalanche documentation and expand on the provided smart contracts. Happy coding!
